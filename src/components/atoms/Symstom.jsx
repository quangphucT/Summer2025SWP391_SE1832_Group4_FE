              <b>Fever</b>: A high fever may occur 2â€“4 weeks after exposure. It

            <li>
              <b>Swollen lymph nodes</b>: Lymph nodes may become enlarged and
              tender as the immune system responds to the virus.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Weight loss</b>: Unexplained weight loss may indicate immune
              system deterioration caused by HIV.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Skin rash</b>: A reddish rash, usually not itchy, may develop
              in the early stages of HIV infection.

            <li>
              <b>Diarrhea</b>: Persistent diarrhea can occur in early HIV
              infection and may require dietary care and medical attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mouth ulcers</b>: Painful sores in the mouth can make eating
